# FoodWasteAndData
Today, the world faces uncertainity of food security largely due to food wastage along the whole food supply chain. 
Over a third of all food produced (around 2.5 billion tons) is lost or wasted each year. One year of this occurs in the food production stage. Bostion Consulting
Group (BCG) estimates this wasted food is worht $230 billion.

Researchers estimate the lost food calories from food waste amount to roughly 24% of the total available food
calories. Ti put this in perspective, the UN reports that about a third of the global population, mostly in developing countries
and low income countries, didn't have enough access to food in 2020, an increase of 320 million people from the previous year.

According to UCU Mukono, food wastage makes up 65-79% of solid waste in landfills in Uganda causing environemental and health probleems.
Globally, the problem is predicted to increase causing higher global food insecurity.
